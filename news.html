								<p>After weeks of planning it's finally here! 

									The GameNation Valorant Cup Tournament! 

								   

								   Valorant is a free to play PC game.

								   It has a 5v5 match system with low graphics,   so almost everyone can play this game as low spec'd systems can play it. (Smart Devs). 

								   

								   GameNation has created the Valorant Cup to showcase the best African players to the world. It boasts of a fair system where teamwork is key rather than individual skill.

								   Cash Prize is 10k and at this point, pretty much anyone can win it. 

								   Registration is open for a limited time.

								   

								   

								   Also, we finally have our very own GameNation Valorant dedicated WhatsApp group. We are pleased to bring to you: 

								   

									GameNation Juliet

								<p>HELLO NATION, 



									SO WE TRIED OUT OUR VERY FIRST SPONSORSHIP ON WEDNESDAY AND IT WAS EXCITING. WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN PLANNING THIS FOR A VERY LONG TIME, AND ITS BEEN A "NO" and "YES" CONTEST. 

									ANYWAY, LETS RUN YOU THROUGH. 

									

									IN THE PAST, REWARDS, PAYMENTS, GIVEAWAYS, ETC, HAVE ALWAYS COME FROM GAMENATION ALONE, BUT WE HAVE AN AMAZING COMMUNITY WHO APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT WE PUT IN AND ALWAYS WANT TO HELP OUT. 

									

									WITH THAT, GAMENATION INTRODUCES:

									SPONSORED POSTS.

									

									MEMBERS OF GAMENATION CAN NOW DONATE TO GAMENATION OR PAY TO ADVERTISE THEIR BUSINESSES, SERVICES OR PRODUCTS IN LINKS. 

									Sponsored messages will have the phrase: 

									"sparkles This match was sponsored by ......." at the bottom of our hype messages or room details messages. 

									Funds received will go to winners of the rooms. All adverts will be checked by staff of GameNation to make sure our people are safe, but still be careful in engaging the business/product owner. 

									

									So, if you have any business, product or service you want to advertise, or you are just simply feeling generous, don't hesitate to buzz any of the Admins. GameNation has close to 2000 members, and all funds go back to GameNation. 

									

									We have more great news coming your way soon. Stay frosty!</p>
